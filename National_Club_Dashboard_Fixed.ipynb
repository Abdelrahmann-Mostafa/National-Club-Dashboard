    "### Questions the Dashboard Answers:\n",
    "1. **Games Analysis**: Which sports have the highest participation and revenue?\n",
    "2. **Player Rankings**: What is the distribution of player ranks across the club?\n",
    "3. **Branch Performance**: Which branches have the most members and highest income?\n",
    "4. **Financial Trends**: How does income compare to expenses throughout the year?\n",
    "5. **Game Distribution**: How are different sports distributed across branches?\n",
    "6. **Player Performance**: Who are the top-performing players by achievements?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart Type Selections:\n",
    "- **Column Charts**: Used for comparing discrete categories (games participation, branch members)\n",
    "- **Line Charts**: Used for showing trends over time (income vs expenses)\n",
    "- **Pie Charts**: Used for showing proportions (rank distribution)\n",
    "- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Used for showing composition within categories (game distribution by branch)\n",
    "- **Horizontal Bar Charts**: Used for ranking/top-N displays (top players)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboard Design Choices:\n",
    "- **Interactive Filtering**: Branch filter allows users to focus on specific locations\n",
    "- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme for better visual hierarchy\n",
    "- **Responsive Layout**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes\n",
    "- **Tooltips**: Detailed information on hover for better user experience\n",
    "- **Legends**: Clear labeling of data series\n",
    "- **Web-based**: Accessible through any modern browser\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation:\n",
    "- **AmCharts Library**: Professional charting library as required\n",
    "- **Data Source**: CSV file with 200 real names + generated data\n",
    "- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Python data processing\n",
    "- **Interactivity**: Click interactions, hover effects, and filtering\n",
